# Qudits

A simulation library for quantum computing using qudits {n-dimensional qubits (quantum digits)}.

As I learn from 'Introduction to Quantum Computing: From a Layperson to a Programmer in 30 Steps' by Hiu Yung Wong, I will be implementing the code exercise in the book while understanding the underlying mathematics and extending it beyond qubits to qudits.

I believe implementation of qudits is more viable using photonic quantum computing given the beautiful similarities between wave nature of light and quantum computing.

## Latest Update: Completed first 7 chapters (till Pauli Spin Matrices, Adjoint Matrix, and Hermitian Matrix)


## Log:
- Currently implementing GPU acceleration using torch, but plan to eventually shift to native GPU backend.


## Long term goals:
- Integrade Quantum Machine Learning Models (reference QML by Peter Wittek)
- Integrate photonics to enable photonic quantum computing for qudits (reference strawberryfields by PennyLane)
- Include Neuromorphic Computing Models (reference snntorch)

  
- Integrate all to create a Neuromorphic Photonic Quantum Machine Learning Library, supporting (or maybe needing) qudits ?

## Licensing:
I do plan to eventually license it, but thats on the horizon for now.
